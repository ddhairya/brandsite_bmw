# Requirements
A single page responsive [BMW WorkShop](https://bmw.org.pl/)brand site in HTML using Bootstrap5, animation and a php backend.

## Technologies
1.  Google Font - For Font
2.  Bootstrap - For styling
3.  Gsap - For animation trigger
4.  ScrollMagic - For animation trigger
5.  Ajax Request - For posting Data and Getting text Response
6.  PHPMailer - For sending the contact form data as a mail

## Walk Through
Started with lots of different animation effect and ended with simple and elegant minimal animation to meet the needs. 
A simple liftover intro page and a left to right slider for each section ans services.

## Complexity
Was a straight forward site except the finalizing about the animation effect and font didn't had much of a chanlenging task.

## Solution
Have followed the Agile techmique to minimize the rework and closing up the gap with needs. As it wasn't clear from the start how site should look and what was actually required.
As an instance once we reach to an end, the requirment to send contact form data in a mail arise.
